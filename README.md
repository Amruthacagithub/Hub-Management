# My Website Project

This project consists of a frontend built with React, a backend with Express, and uses Concurrently to run both the frontend and backend together.

## Installation Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn** (npm comes with Node.js, or you can install Yarn globally via `npm install -g yarn`)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Install backend dependencies (Express):**

    Navigate to your backend folder (if you have a separate one, otherwise it’s in the root directory):

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies (React):**

    Navigate to your frontend folder (if you have a separate one):

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

4. **Install root project dependencies (Concurrently):**

    Go back to your root project directory:

    ```bash
    cd ..
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Project

You can run both the frontend and backend simultaneously using `concurrently`.

1. **Start the development server:**

    From the root project directory:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command will run both the frontend (React) and backend (Express) using Concurrently.

### File Structure

- `frontend/` – React frontend files
- `backend/` – Express backend files
- `package.json` – Dependencies and scripts to run the project
- `README.md` – Project documentation

### Scripts

- `npm run dev` – Runs both the frontend and backend in development mode using Concurrently.
- `npm run start` – Starts the backend in production mode.
- `npm run client` – Starts the React development server.

### Notes

- You can customize the `concurrently` commands as needed to fit your specific project structure.
- Make sure your environment variables (like API keys) are correctly set in your `.env` files.
